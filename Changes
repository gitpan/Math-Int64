Revision history for Perl extension Math::Int64.

0.22  Jun 4, 2012
       - more fixes for MS compiler
       - test for uint64 to NV conversions added

0.21  Jun 4, 2012 
       - make other and rev arguments optional for overloading methods
         when possible so that they can be called directly

0.20  Jun 3, 2012
        - several fixes for MS compiler (bug reports and testing by
          bulk88 at PerlMonks)
        - native_to_uint64 was broken

0.19  Jun 1, 2012
        - do not overflow on shifts
        - add limits constants

0.18_04  Dec 25, 2011
        - optimize SV to int64/uint64 conversions
        - switch perl stack before calling as_int64/as_uint64 methods

0.18_03  Dec 23, 2011
        - uint64 multiplication and shift operations were broken,
          corrected
        - add support for as_int64 and as_uint64 callbacks
        - make native_if_available a lexical pragma, there is some
          risk of breaking old code using this pragma selectively on
          5.8.x perls
        - doc improvements

0.18_02  Dec 20, 2011
        - make it run in perls 5.8, 5.10 and 5.12
        - several doc corrections
        - document die_on_overflow.pm

0.18_01  Dec 19, 2011
        - released to CPAN just for CPAN Testers feedback
        - add support for die_on_overflow feature

        - include ppport.h in perl_math_int64.c

0.15  May 27, 2011
        - update ppport.h from Devel::PPPort 3.19 as some perlapi
          functions not available on perls older than 5.10 are now
          used.

0.14  May 27, 2011
        - add support for 64bit random number generation
        - selectively import subs from Math::Int64 or from ...::Native

0.13  May 26, 2011
        - there were a couple of bugs on the str to int64 conversion
          code

0.12  May 26, 2011
        - add support for several string to int64 conversion functions
        - replace usage of strtoll and friends for custom strtoint64

0.11  May 25, 2011
        - introduce C API
        - require perl 5.8.x

0.10  Feb 8, 2011
        - solved bug in uint64_to_number
        - replace sprintf by hand crafted int64 to string conversor

0.09  Oct 23, 2009
        - native backend was failing due to different semantics under
          perls compiled with long double support

0.08  Oct 17, 2009
        - Fallback to native 64bit support if available feature added

0.07  Oct 17, 2009
        - IV backend for computers with native 64bit IVs

0.06  Oct 17, 2009
        - syntax error was broken compilation with MS compiler (bug
          report by Taro Nishino)

0.05  Oct 16, 2009
        - some bit operations were broken (bug report by Adam Woodworth)

0.04  Sep 10, 2009
        - make it work under Strawberry Perl and probably other perl
          Windows ports! (bug report and patch by Sisyphus)

0.03  Apr 5, 2007
        - use SvIOK_UV instead of SvUOK (that's not supported in older
          perls)
        - int64_to_net and uint64_to_net were only accepting
          Math::U?Int64 objects
        - some more tests added

0.02  Apr 4, 2007
        - support for uint64 added
        - autodetect strtoll, atoll, etc. support
