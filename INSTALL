This is the Perl distribution Math-Int64.

Installing Math-Int64 is straightforward.

## Installation with cpanm

If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

    % cpanm Math::Int64

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass the
"-S" flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the module:

    % cpanm -S Math::Int64

## Installing with the CPAN shell

Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

    % cpan Math::Int64

## Manual installation

As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the tarball, untar it,
then build it:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to run:

    % sudo make install

## Documentation

Math-Int64 documentation is available as POD.
You can run perldoc from a shell to read the documentation:

    % perldoc Math::Int64
